#  Course Management System (Java OOP)

This is a simple **Java console-based Course Management System** developed using **Object-Oriented Programming** principles.

##  Project Structure

The project is organized into **multiple separate `.java` class files** to keep the code clean, tidy, and easier to manage.  
Each class handles a specific part of the system:

- `Person.java` — Base class for shared person attributes.
- `Course.java` — Class for course information.
- `Teacher.java` — Inherits from `Person`, handles teacher details and assigned courses.
- `Student.java` — Inherits from `Person`, manages student details and registered courses.
- `CourseManagementSystem.java` — Manages all the lists of courses, teachers, and students.
- `Main.java` — Contains the program's entry point and a simple console menu for user interaction.

## How to Run

1. Open the project folder in your preferred Java IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code).
2. **Ensure all `.java` files are in the same package or directory.**
3. Run the `Main.java` file.
4. Use the console menu to interact with the system.

## Features

- Add new Courses, Teachers, and Students.
- Assign courses to teachers.
- Register courses for students.
- Display all available courses, teachers (with assigned courses), and students (with registered courses).

## Technologies Used

- Java
- OOP (Inheritance, Encapsulation, ArrayLists)
- Console-based interaction

## Note

> **Only run the `Main.java` file** to start the program.  
> All other classes are designed separately to keep the code organized and modular.
